# Zypher Bot Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Zypher (the "Bot") collects, uses, and protects your information when you interact with the Bot.

## 1. Information Collection
Zypher collects minimal information necessary for the functionality of its commands. This includes:
- Discord usernames, user IDs, and server information (such as server ID and roles).
- Messages sent to the Bot in order to respond to commands.

Zypher **does not** collect personal information like email addresses or any other sensitive data.

## 2. Usage of Information
The information collected by Zypher is used solely to provide Bot functionality, including but not limited to:
- Moderation commands like `ban`, `kick`, and `addrole`.
- Fun commands like `8ball`, `roast`, and `trivia`.
- Image manipulation commands such as `blur`, `deepfry`, and `supreme`.

We do not sell, share, or distribute your data to third parties.

## 3. Data Storage
All data is stored temporarily and is cleared regularly. Zypher does not store any user data long-term unless required for moderation purposes (e.g., temporary bans). The data collected is stored in a secure environment and is only accessible by the Bot and its developers.

## 4. User Control
Users can request the deletion of their data by contacting the Bot developers via the `contact` command or through Discord. Upon request, any stored data will be deleted promptly.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Zypher may integrate third-party services (such as Reddit or COVID APIs) to enhance user experience. These services may collect additional data, but Zypher does not control or access this data. Please refer to the privacy policies of those services for more information.

## 6. Changes to this Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be reflected in this document, and continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of any updated terms.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the Bot developers through the `contact` command or via Discord.

Thank you for trusting Zypher!
